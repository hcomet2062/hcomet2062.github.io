			<p id="intro">I'm an incoming freshman college student delving into the world of computer science. I've loved programming since my exposure in high school and I know there is so much for me to explore in this field. My goal is to become a software engineer but that could all be subject to change.</p>

			<h2>Hobbies</h2>
			<p>I'm a really musically inclined person so I played the piano for 10 years and the violin for 5 years. Playing the piano growing up, I participated in school talent shows and a couple of competitions, but I never won. I joined an orchestra in my area called DYSO and we played at retirement centers and hospitals during the holiday season. In my junior year, I tied with a celloist in DYSO's first concerto competition. See here for the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mKZxoIap38">video</a>.</p>

			<p>Another hobby of mine in the past was speed stacks. Back when it was super popular, I would obsess over it. I was moderately good at it but not at a competitive level of course. </p>
