			<p>I'm a really musically inclined person so I played the piano for 10 years and the violin for 5 years. Playing the piano growing up, I participated in school talent shows and a couple of competitions, but I never won. I joined an orchestra in my area called DYSO and we played at retirement centers and hospitals during the holiday season. In my junior year, I tied with a cellist in DYSO's first concerto competition. See here for the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mKZxoIap38">video</a>.</p>
